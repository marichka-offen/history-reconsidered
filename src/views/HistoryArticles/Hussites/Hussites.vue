    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      The Kingdom of Bohemia was predominantly Slavic in ethnicity, having been
      established by the Slavs who settled in what had been a Celtic region of
      Eastern Europe. In the 13th century, the presence of large silver deposits
      and the willingness of its rulers to encourage ethnic Germans to exploit
      and develop this wealth resulted in a large German minority in Bohemia.
      The Germans came to occupy positions of prominence in the trade guilds and
      churches in the urban areas like Prague, Kutna Hora (Kuttenberg), Nemecky
      Brod (Deutchbrod). This influx of Germans, and their subsequent prominent
      role created considerable resentment in the Slavic native population.

      <b>Jan Hus (1371 - 1415)</b>
      , an ethnic Slav, graduated from Charles University (Univerzita Karlova)
      in Prague and in 1398 began lecturing there. He was rector from 1402-03
      and 1409-10 and was an extremely popular clergyman among the Slavs, both
      noble and peasant preaching to both on the hills outside Prague. He became
      a proponent of the ideas of the English reformer and theologian John
      Wycliffe. Huss like Wycliffe denounced the immorality of clergy, the sale
      of indulgences, accumulation of wealth by the clergy and the church and
      saw the Bible as the final authority in ecclesiastical matters. He was a
      proponent of the laity taking communion in both kinds, that is to say the
      bread and the wine, at a time when only the clergy received communion in
      both kinds. He translated the Bible into the language of the people and
      said “ Women were made in the image of God and should fear no man” setting
      the stage for women to preach at Hussite services and participate in
      governing councils, not to mention fight beside their men in battle. It
      was the teaching and writing about his radical ideas that brought the
      attention of the Pope to Jan Hus. Hus was commanded by one of, at the time
      two, Popes to appear before a General Council of the Church in November
      1414 at Constance in Germany.

    <p>
      The Holy Roman Emperor, Sigismund, granted him a safe conduct to travel
      from Prague to Constance and back to Prague. Upon his arrival at
      Constance, Hus was immediately imprisoned and the Council convened to try
      him for heresy. A Group of 452 nobles from the Kingdom of Bohemia, and
      Poland-Lithuania attempted to intercede on Huss’s behalf to the Council,
      but to no avail. Huss was burned at the stake and reportedly said to the
      executioner ”You are going to burn a goose (Hus meant “goose” in Czech)
      but soon you will have a swan you cannot roast or boil.” The nobility and
      people of Bohemia were enraged but did not take any action against the
      Church or German ethnic minority. Instead, they began to conduct their own
      services with their own clergy, separate from the German Catholic
      churches. They called themselves “Calixtines” from the Latin, “calyx”, or
      in Slavic “kalich” meaning chalice an illusion to their practice of taking
      both he bread and the wine at communion. In 1419 Wenceslas, King of
      Bohemia died. Sigismund, the Holy Roman Emperor who had promised Hus safe
      passage through Germany and brother to Wenseslas claimed the Bohemian
      Crown for himself and swore to exterminate the heretics.

    </blockquote>
    <h6>– Ziska of the Chalice, 1420</h6>
    <p>
      <b>Jan Ziska</b> first appears as the leader of a war band of “Lapkas” or
      mercenaries in the service of King Wenceslas of Bohemia. By 1410 after a
      royal pardon for “excesses” committed in the service of the King, he was
      appointed Royal Gate Keeper. In 1410, Ziska was with the Bohemian force
      that aided the Polish-Lithuanian Union against the Teutonic Knights. Ziska
      returned to Bohemia with an enhanced reputation and knowledge of the use
      of guns and war wagons on the battlefield. Ziska joined Henry V of England
      against the French and participated in the battle of Agincourt on 25
      October 1415. His participation in Henry’s campaign prevented him from
      joining the other 452 Bohemian nobles in their protest to the accusation
      made by the Council of Constance that Jan Hus was a heretic. In 1419 after
      the death of King Wenceslas, Ziska took military control of the Hussites,
      specifically the Taborite faction. Ziska’s first action against those who
      opposed the Hussites was against a force raised by Queen Sophia, the widow
      of King Wenceslas. The Hussites were enroute to a great field outside of
      Prague for an open air religious service when the mounted knights in
      Sophia’s service set them upon. Ziska ordered the Hussite women to cover
      the ground between then Hussites and the knights with their gowns and head
      coverings. When the horses’ feet were entangled in the clothing, their
      riders were thrown and the Hussites fell upon them and killed them to a
      man. Ziska led the forces that defeated Sigismund’s Crusade of 1420 and
      was elected President of the Bohemian Diet at Czaslau in 1421. Already
      blind in one eye, Ziska lost his other eye in the siege of Rabi in 1421
      yet continued to lead his army. Ziska halted Sigismund’s Crusade of 1421,
      invaded Austria and Moravia in 1423 and fought against his fellow Hussites
      and defeated them at the Battle of Malesov. His Lieutenant and later
      successor advised peace with the Utraquists when Ziska was enroute Prague
      to burn it to the ground. A peace was concluded and shortly thereafter
      Ziska died of the plague enroute to invade Bohemia.

    <h6>Ziska’s Battle Song</h6>
    <h3>Hussite Sects</h3>
    <h4>Utraquists</h4>
    <p>
      The name is based on the practice of taking communion “under both kinds”,
      or “sub utraque specie.” This was the moderate element of the Hussites,
      comprised mostly of the merchant class and minor nobility in the urban
      areas, especially Prague. They benefited greatly from the confiscation of
      property from the Catholic churches. This faction attempted to negotiate
      with Emperor Sigismund in 1419-1420 with no success.
    </p>
    <h4>Taborites</h4>
    <p>
      The Taborites represented the most radical sect in Hussitism, believing in
      equality under the law for noble and commoner, the equal distribution of
      wealth, communal ownership of property and decision making by elected
      council rather than noble fiat. To the Taborites, clergy were unnecessary,
      biblical interpretation was an individual matter, their communion services
      were held on hilltops and their children were baptized in rivers and
      ponds. They established themselves in the fortress town of Tabor.
    </p>
    <h4>Orebites</h4>
    <p>
      Established by Ziska in 1423 under the name “Oreb Union” named after a
      hill near the town Orebovice. He had become dissatisfied with the
      indiscipline of the Taborites and introduced a strict military discipline
      among this group he took with him out of the Taborite faction. He enforced
      a strict system of justice under which all were seen as equal under the
      law, all loot was equally distributed and hoarders were executed. Upon the
      death of Ziska, they took the name of “Orphans” and carried a banner with
      the image of Ziska on a white horse.
      <br />
      <br />Adamites. A small short lived sect of Hussites that believed that
      all should live as Adam and Eve did. Their belief in the need to go naked
      doubtless contributed to their suppression by Ziska in 1421.
    </p>
    <h3>The Wars</h3>
    <blockquote>
      “Day and night are the same to you, as you cannot see, but they are not
      the same to us.”
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      “How! You cannot see! Well, set fire to a couple of villages”
    </blockquote>
    <h6>An Exchange between Ziska and his men after he was blinded</h6>
    <h4>1419</h4>
    <p>
      Ziska besieged Nekmer with a force of 400 Hussites and is attacked by a
      relief column larger than his force and is able to retreat using wagon
      mounted artillery to delay the relief force.
    </p>
    <h4>Crusade of 1420</h4>
    <p>
      Ziska and 12 wagons with 400 infantry are attacked while under a flag of
      truce by upwards of 200 cavalry. The Hussites establish a defensive
      position anchored on a pond. The Crusaders attack on foot but are forces
      to withdraw having sustained numerous casualties.
      <br />
      <br />Sigismund declared a Crusade against the Hussites and took Prague.
      Ziska fortified Vitkov Hill overlooking Prague forcing Sigismund to
      withdraw with an army divided by dissention over the division of loot
      between German, Slovenian and Hungarian soldiers. The Taborites are
      received as heroes in Prague until the townspeople come to resent the
      strict rules imposed by the Taborites. The Taborites are driven out of
      Prague by the more moderate Utraquists.
      <br />
      <br />An Utraquist army besieged Vysehrad Castle under the command of
      Hynek Krusina. Sigismund sends a relief force that is defeated and the
      Castle falls to the Hussites.
      <br />
      <br />The Bohemain Diet convenes at Czaslau where Ziska is elected
      President of the Diet and the Four Articles of Prague are adopted which
      proclaimed religious freedom, celebration of the Mass receiving bread and
      wine, redistribution of excessive church wealth and equality before the
      law for all, noble commoner and clergy alike.
    </p>
    <h4>Crusade of 1421</h4>
    <p>
      Sigismund declares a second Crusade invading Bohemia with two armies, one
      from Silesia and another led by Sigismund himself comprised of Hungarians
      and Serbians. The Silesians flee at the approach of the Hussite Army.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>21 December 1421</b> The army led by Sigismund met Ziska’s force
      outside the town and out maneuvered the wagenberg, taking the town and
      forcing Ziska to retreat. Sigismund dispersed his forces anticipating the
      Hussites would go into winter quarters.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>6 January 1422</b> Ziska surprised and routed a Hungarian force at
      Nevobiby.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>8 January 1422</b> Sigismund gathers his forces from winter quarters on
      the high ground outside the village of Habry and was quickly routed.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>10 January 1422</b>
      The Hussite army besieges, takes and sacks Nemecky Brod.
    </p>
    <h4>Hussite raids into Moravia and Austria in 1423</h4>
    <p>
      <b>April 1423</b> A Bohemian force loyal to Sigismund comprised of
      cavalry, cannon and war wagons attacked Siska’s army positioned on high
      ground. After multiple assaults, Ziska counter attacked out of his
      defensive positioned and routed his attackers.
    </p>
    <h4>Bohemian Civil War of 1424</h4>
    <p>
      Ziska led away those of the Taborites that would follow and established
      the Oberite sect. Ziska defeats an army sent against him from Prague at
      the battle of Malesov and the Hussite factions are reconciled.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>June to October 1424</b> Utraquist, Orebite and Polish joint forces
      conduct campaign in Moravia. Campaign abandoned by the death of Ziska.
    </p>
    <h4>Crusade of 1426</h4>
    <p>
      The Pope declared a crusade, thinking the Hussites vulnerable as a result
      of Ziska’s death.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>15 June 1426</b> A Hussite force besieged Usti nad Labem and were
      attacked by a much larger German Crusading army of 70 to 100 thousand men
      (according to contemporary accounts) attacked the Bohemian entrenched
      “wagenberg” of 500 wagons established on high ground and was defeated
      losing as many as 15 thousand dead, 50 thousand lost or wounded. The
      Hussites sustained 30 losses.
    </p>
    <h4>Crusade of 1427</h4>
    <p>
      <b>4 August 1427</b> A Crusade led by Henry De Beaufort, Bishop of
      Winchester gathered its forces and was defeated by a Bohemian Army
      comprised of Hussites and Catholics at the city of Meiss. The Crusaders
      fled without a fight and suffered considerable casualties from the
      villagers they had pillaged enroute to Meiss.
      <br />
      <br />In <b>1429</b> Procopius, elected leader of the Hussites, assembled
      the Bohemian Diet in Prague and gained its consent to go to Vienna to
      approach Sigismund about a peace treaty. Sigismund refused to accept terms
      that were the same as the 1420 Articles of Prague
      <br />
      <br />On <b>23 March 1430</b> Joan of Arc (or, as it was signed by her
      Confessor for her, “Joan the Maiden”) dictated a letter to the “heretics
      of Bohemia” threatening to lead a crusade against them.
    </p>
    <h4>The Beautiful Rides (spanile jizdy) of 1428-31</h4>
    <p>
      The Hussites raid far and wide into Germany, Austria, Hungary and Poland.
    </p>
    <h4>Crusade of 1431</h4>
    <p>
      <b>14 August 1431</b> An army of 130 thousand German Crusaders (according
      to contemporary accounts) led by Frederick of Brandenberg fled in panic at
      the sight of the Hussite force at Domazlice. The Crusaders suffered
      considerable casualties from the villagers they had pillaged enroute to
      Domazlice.
    </p>
    <h4>Compacta of Basle</h4>
    <p>
      On
      <b>January 9 1433</b> 300 Hussites entered Basle and after 50 days of
      negotiation, when on the verge of leaving Basle, terms were reached
      granting them the terms of the Four Articles of Prague. The Articles
      remained the religious law of Bohemia until 1567 when the Hussites
      divided, some going back to Catholicism and some joined with the Lutherans
      drawing up the Confessio Bohemia which was recognized by the Holy Roman
      Emperor’ in 1609 and grated considerable religious freedom to Bohemia..
      The violation of this letter set the stage for the 30 Years War.
    </p>
    <h4>Civil War of 1434</h4>
    <p>
      The Oberites and Taborites refuse to accept the agreement of Basle.
      Oberite and Taborite armies meet an army raised by members of the nobility
      and Prague at Lipany and are defeated by them.
      <br />
      <br />In <b>1457</b> George of Podebrady, Bohemia’s only Hussite king
      ascends to the throne and defeats a Hungarian Crusader army in 1468. After
      the death of Poderbrady, Bohemia became a part of the Holy Roman Empire.
    </p>
    <h4>Involvement of the Polish Lithuanian Union</h4>
    <p>
      When the Polish Lithuanian Union was under threat from the Teutonic
      Knights and their German and Hungarian allies, the Kingdom of Bohemia sent
      3000 soldiers, Jan Ziska among them, to aid their fellow Slavs. They were
      present at the battle of Grunwald in 1410 and participated in the siege of
      Malbork, the Teutonic Order’s capital. From 1421 to 1427 the Hussites
      received considerable military support from the Polish-Lithuanian Union.
      This support took the form of mercenaries, volunteers and materiel. Jan
      Ziska and the Bohemian Diet went so far as to offer the crown to Ladislaus
      Jagiello, King of Poland and a Lithuanian who refused it under pressure
      from his Catholic Clergy. The Crown was offered to Withold, The Grand Duke
      of Lithuania who sent his nephew Zygmunt Korybut to serve as his regent in
      Bohemia. Korybut was unable to, as he had hoped, to return the Bohemian to
      the Catholic Church and found himself at times fighting the Taborites as
      well as the Orebites. Official Polish-Lithuanian Union involvement came to
      an end in 1427 with the discovery of Korybut’s plot to betray the Hussites
      to Emperor Sigismund. Sigismund and the Pope engineered Polish-Lithuanian
      Union’s disengagement with the Hussites by threatening a crusade and
      providing support to the Teutonic Knights. Despite the departure of
      Korybut, it is safe to assume the continued presence of Poles and
      Lithuanians among the Bohemians. Once more in 1433 the Hussites joined the
      Polish-Lithuanian Union in a war against the Teutonic knights and
      penetrated north all the way to the mouth of the Vistula River on the
      Baltic Sea.
    </p>
    <h4>The Hussite Armies</h4>
    <blockquote>
      “They camped in the field with their women and children, who accompanied
      the army, as they had a large number of wagons with which they drew up a
      wall-like fortification. When they moved out for battle, they formed two
      lines of these wagons, which enclosed for foot troops, while the horsemen
      remained outside without moving off to any distance.”
    </blockquote>
    <h6>
      Enea Silvio Piccolomini (later Pope Pius II)
      <br />from his ‘Historia Bohemia,'
    </h6>
    <p>
      The Hussite armies were predominantly peasant infantry armies with the
      minor nobility serving as light cavalry. There was no attempt to replicate
      in the Hussite force the heavy armored knight so prevalent throughout the
      rest of Europe. The use of war wagons combined with crossbows and firearms
      can be attributed to Jan Ziska’s experiences in Poland but it was more
      than a technical innovation that led to so many successes against those
      invading Bohemia and those defending their land from the Bohemian forces.
      <br />
      <br />The egalitarian nature of Hussitism resulted in a military force in
      which women as well as men were expected to fight, where battlefield loot
      was evenly distributed and any and all infractions were punished in the
      same fashion, regardless of social status. Leaders were chosen based upon
      ability and not social standing. The Hussite army was well trained,
      disciplined and ideologically motivated unlike the vast majority of
      military forces of the time. All this combined with the effective use of
      the most advanced technological innovations of the time made a literally
      unbeatable combination.
    </p>
    <h4>Weapons</h4>
    <p>
      War Wagon. The War Wagon is an ancient weapon with possible origins as old
      as the Sythians. The Saga of Haakon Broad Shoulder in Snorre Sturlason’s
      ‘Heimskringla or the Lives of Norse Kings”, claims the Norse Varangian
      Guard broke a “wagonberg” in Rumania along the Danube around 1161.
      <br />
      <br />Ideally each of the wagons was manned by 10-20 soldiers, which could
      be men or women in keeping with Hussite practice of encouraging women to
      fight alongside the men. The goal was to have 2 handgunners, 6
      crossbowmen, and up to 16 armed with polearms. There would be 2 soldiers
      responsible for handling the pavaises, or standing shields assigned to the
      wagon. The wagon was to have a supply of axes, shovels, pickaxes, hoes,
      and shovels with at least two of each to allow for ditching in front of
      the wagonberg when in a defensive posture.
      <br />
      <br />There were commanders for each wagon, per 10 wagons and per 50-100
      wagons and one commander for the infantry, wagons and cavalry in the army.
      There can be little doubt that the use of war wagons and guns was brought
      back to Bohemia by Jan Ziska and those Bohemians who supported the Poles
      in 1410 against the Teutonic knights. Ziska however used the war wagon in
      an innovative manner that suited the type or warfare the Hussites were
      engaged in. The Hussites did not lack for motivated manpower but were
      lacking in a mounted force that could meet the mounted forces of their
      enemies. The war wagons arrayed in a linear or semi linear formation tied
      in with terrain that was impassible to horses or in a laager on dominating
      terrain could provide an active defense against a mounted or dismounted
      force of greater size. An attacking formation was initially subject to
      concentrated crossbow and gunfire. If the attritted formation was still
      intact and advancing, they faced infantry with polearms fighting from
      inside or between the chained wagons of the wagonberg. Stones were even
      available for those in the wagon to throw at the attacking force. It was
      the critical point in time when the attacking formation was in greatest
      disarray that the Hussite commander unleashed his typically small mounted
      formation from within the wagonberg to attack and pursue the attacking
      force. Once the pursuit began the infantry came from behind the wagonberg
      and participated in it. It is a credit to the discipline of the Hussite
      mounted forces that there are no accounts of them pursuing a defeated
      enemy to the point of putting themselves at risk of counter attack or
      beyond the point where they could cover and support the wagonberg.

    <p>
      When the war wagons were on the move, they typically adopted a 4-column
      formation. The baggage train would move with two columns on either side of
      it. The outer columns or “krajn” were longer that the two inner columns or
      “placni” so they could form an outer circle all the way around the inner
      circle when the wagonberg was established.
      <br />
      <br />Cross bows. There were a considerable number of crossbows in the
      Hussite army, despite the tendency on the part of historians to make far
      more of the presence of firearms. Crossbows shared with the firearms of
      the time the advantages of being easy to train and relatively
      uncomplicated to manufacture and maintain. All these attributes make them
      both ideal for armies comprised of large numbers of relatively
      inexperienced soldiers. The primary disadvantage of the crossbow was the
      time it took to prepare it for firing.

      Hand Gonnes. The hand held firearms of the time were essentially tubes on
      sticks ranging from .40-1.00. caliber. They could with practice be
      accurate out to a range of perhaps 50 yards. Given the smoke and noise
      when fired, they also doubtless had greater unnerving effect on the enemy
      than their lethality.

    <h4>Cannon</h4>
    <p>
      The Hussites employed two types of cannon, the lighter of the two being
      the most prevalent. The “Tarasnice” was like the hand gonne of the time a
      tube on a stick but was of a larger caliber, perhaps anywhere from .75 to
      1.00. It was mounted on a small platform that initially was not wheeled
      but had wheels added later and was employed between the wagons of the
      wagonberg. The “Houfnice” was the wheeled heavy artillery of the Hussites
      and was employed on special wagons. There is reason to believe that their
      first appearance was at the battle of Aussig in 1426, but wheeled heavy
      artillery was already in use in other parts of Europe even earlier. I can
      only surmise from photos that this artillery piece would fire a projectile
      at least several inches in diameter.

    <h4>Cannister or grape shot</h4>
    <p>
      There is evidence to support the use of canister/grapeshot/ buckshot in
      firearms against the Teutonic Knights in 1410 as well as by Hussite
      mercenaries fighting for the Poles in the late 15th century. Given this it
      would be very probable that the Hussites used it as well.
    </p>
    <h4>Polearms</h4>
    <p>
      The Hussites used a variety of polearms, primary the purpose of which were
      to forcibly dismount a rider, making him more vulnerable to dismounted
      attack. The weapon most commonly associated with the Hussites is the
      flail, an agricultural threshing tool with spikes placed on the short end
      chained to a 6 foot pole. Halberds, bardiches, axes and any number of
      polearms found their way into the hands of the Hussites as a result of
      “battlefield pick ups.”
    </p>
    <h4>Armor and swords</h4>
    <p>
      These would have come into the hands of most Hussites as a result of
      “battlefield pick ups” and distributed loot.
