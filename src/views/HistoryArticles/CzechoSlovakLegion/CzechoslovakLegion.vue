    <b>
      The Czar of Russia gave permission for the formation of a military
      organization comprised of Czech and Slovak immigrants under Russian
      Officers. Thus was born what later became the Czechoslovak Legion.
    </b>
    <p>
      The Legion fought first for the Czar, then the Russian Revolutionary
      Government that briefly followed the Czar, and the Allies against the
      Central Powers. With the end of World War I, the Legion fought, initially
      for their own survival, the Bolsheviks, as an Allied military formation,
      making their way across 4000 miles of Russia to Vladivostok, and from
      there to home. The Legion’s story involves events in Russia, decisions
      made in the capitals for Europe, numerous Allied armies, and a government
      created in exile for a Czechoslovak state that did not exist, initially,
      except in the minds of its founders.
      <br />
      <br />The Legion captured the imagination and commanded the respect of the
      Allied nations and gave legitimacy to the Czechoslovak government in
      exile’s claim to self-rule.
      <br />
      <br />As I write this book, the Legion will remain at the center of the
      story, but it is important to look at a context larger than their actions
      to understand their accomplishments.
      <br />
      <br />What they did was no less than earn nationhood for the Czechoslovak
      people. Watch this page for updates about the book.
