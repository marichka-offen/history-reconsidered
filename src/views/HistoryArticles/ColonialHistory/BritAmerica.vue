    <h2>The British Military Presence in America, 1660-1720</h2>
    <p>
      The presence of British regular army forces in the American colonies in
      the late 17th century and early 18th century was sporadic at best. This
      period in which Britain was becoming an empire at war intermittently with
      other European Powers, was a time when defending colonial possessions was
      becoming, but was not yet a major priority. This is a small but evolving
      attempt to learn something about and portray those sent to America to
      defend it from natives, pirates and the other major competing adversaries
      in America, those being, initially, the Netherlands, and later Spain and
      France. The wars fought in America during this time that involved regulars
      were King William’s War (1690-98), Queen Anne’s War (1702-13), the War of
      the Quadruple Alliance (1718-20).
      <br>
      <br>In the 17th century and later, soldiers were seen as a dangerous
      burden to those civilian communities they lived in or near. The need for
      protection from hostile natives, pirates, the Spanish and or France in the
      Caribbean seemed to lead to some appreciation for soldiers and former
      soldiers as settlers. During the post-1697 disbandment, Antigua offered a
      bounty and land for those soldiers who stayed on there. In 1688, Antigua
      also offered a pension to wounded soldiers and their children or widows.
      By all indications, this demonstrates a unique view of soldiers. Further
      exploration of the literature is called for to see if this unique attitude
      was common to the North American and other Caribbean colonies.
      <br>
      <br>Regular Regiments. Regular regiments, in whole or in part, were
      involved in both garrison and expeditionary missions in North America and
      the Caribbean during this period. How the regiments were equipped was a
      function of how much the regimental commander was willing to spend on his
      soldiers and where the British army was generally in its transition away
      from pike to bayonet, from matchlock to fire lock, bandoleer of boxes to
      cartridge boxes and the other transitions occurring in the army. Matchlock
      muskets and bandoleers (or “collars”) of charges might have been seen
      throughout the period with vastly decreasing frequency after 1700. Marine
      units would not have had matchlocks in their inventory. Firelocks would
      have been seen in ever increasing numbers throughout the period. Sword
      belts and plug bayonets would have been prevalent from the 1680’s onward.
      I have addressed the regimental colors (coat/facing) of the different
      regular regiments that served in America during the specified time
      wherever possible as well as if they were raised in Ireland. Also, when
      possible, I have provided the numbered regiment designation of those
      regiments that continued to 1757 and the duration of service of those
      regiments that were “broken.”
      <br>
      <br>Independent Companies. The Independent Companies were composed of
      officers and soldiers sent from Britain and not raised locally. Unlike the
      other units of the army that each had distinctive uniform colors, regiment
      dependent, they would have worn Royal Livery colors, that is to say red
      coats faced blue. Commanders were responsible for clothing, arming and
      equipping their soldiers. Each company would have been equipped and
      clothed as any other company for the time it was raised. This being a time
      of great transition in weapons and equipment and there being no uniform
      pattern for clothing and equipment, there is likely to have been a good
      deal of variation between the companies at different locations not to
      mention the differences between the equipment of “old timers” and new
      replacements. When the initial issue was worn out, it was expected that
      the colony, officers or soldiers would replace it. The likelihood that
      such replacement occurred with any degree of regularity is low, given
      multi-year long delays in soldier and officer pay and colonies already
      feeling over taxed by the British government. Equipment and style of
      uniform was a function of when a company deployed from England and when or
      if it was re-supplied and re-equipped.
      <br>
      <br>An Independent Company organization had 50-100 soldiers with one
      Captain, one to two Lieutenants, three sergeants, three corporals and 2
      drummers. There is no mention in the literature of pike being used, only
      muskets. Once a soldier came over with an Independent Company they rarely
      went back to Britain. They either died, as large numbers did, due more to
      conditions than combat, or retired and settled where they had been sent,
      subject to recall at any time. Officers did find their way back to Britain
      on occasion, but staying in the colonies allowed advancement for those
      without the requisite family connections, due to death and or retirement
      of superiors. A lack of family connections would have been likely to land
      officers in the Independent Companies to begin with. Sergeants from
      regular regiments, as opposed to “gentlemen,” were even known to have been
      offered and accepted commissions in the Independent Companies during the
      reign of Queen Anne. These were not prestigious postings for ambitious
      officers.
      <br>
      <br>Why volunteer for service in an Independent Company half a world
      away? Some soldiers didn’t, but were forced to go as punishment for
      desertion and other crimes. Others were from “broken” disbanded regiments
      and wished to remain soldiers. Some were doubtless told they would receive
      their past due pay if they continued to serve.
      <br>
      <br>The army underwent a major draw down in 1697 with the signing of the
      Treaty of Ryswick leading to a 60% reduction of an army of 87,500 men. A
      total of 1500 officers were put on half pay. The Independent Companies
      were an opportunity to continue to serve, and many chose to.
      <br>
      <br>The mission of the Independent Companies was colonial defense as
      well as to augment and support offensive operations. The Independent
      Companies manned garrisons and forts, served as leadership cadre as well
      as trainers for militia forces, and served as marines for Royal Navy and
      Privateer vessels that needed them. Soldiering in the Independent
      Companies no doubt became a part time job, situation and location
      dependent, allowing for casual labor and taking up outside trades. Unlike
      soldiers in mobile regiments, these soldiers became permanent members of
      the community where they were stationed.
    </p>
    <h4>Militia</h4>
    <p>
      The militia was comprised of all able bodied male civilians usually
      between the ages of 18 and 60, led by local prominent community leaders.
      They either brought their own arms or were armed by their commanders.
      There is no evidence I have found of militia uniforms with the exception
      of an effort on the part of the Port Royal Council in the 1680’s to
      provide black hats and red coats to the militia and an eyewitness account
      of the Port Royal militia wearing red coats with blue facings in 1688 .
      Militia rotated through forts and were involved in patrolling frontiers
      areas. In the case of islands and coastal regions militia patrolled areas
      subject to amphibious assault and piracy. Militia were also involved in
      expeditionary operations and subject to serve as marines on Royal Navy
      vessels requiring a complement of marines.
    </p>
    <h4>The Role of Women</h4>
    <p>
      Women had a critical role in the armies of the late 17th and early 18th
      centuries, to the point that armies would feed 15 women per company to
      insure the execution of the essential logistical roles of cooking,
      providing medical support as well as repairing and washing clothes. The
      Independent Companies and militia were no different in this regard. In the
      literature there are two interesting citations concerning the presence of
      women in the Army, the first being a Lieutenant of an unidentified
      Independent Company with smallpox being put ashore with his wife so she
      could nurse him to health. The other is the drowning of 35 women in the
      sinking of a troop ship in the St Lawrence Seaway during the abortive
      attempt on Quebec in 1711. Wherever British soldiers went, their women
      went too.
