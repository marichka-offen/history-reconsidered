    <h2>The Battle of the Severn River, 1655</h2>
    <p>
      In 1648 Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Lord Baltimore reached an agreement with
      William Stone to resettle a group of Puritan settlers who had found
      themselves unwelcome in the Colony of Virginia in his proprietary colony
      of Maryland. Stone brought with him five hundred Puritan settlers who
      established the settlement of Providence, in current Ann Arundel County.
      In August of that same year, Calvert named Stone as Governor of Maryland.
      This was likely due to pressure from Protestant settlers in Maryland as
      well as the defeat of the Royalist Cause and the end of the Second English
      Civil War at the Battle of Preston on 14 August. It was apparent to
      Calvert and others that the Commonwealth Cause was ascendant and it would
      be wise to accommodate it.
      <br />
      <br />The first colonial assembly under Governor Stone was presented with
      an Act Concerning Religion which they modified and adopted as the law in
      Maryland. The Act called for religious toleration and forbade insulting
      language about religion, a first in British Law. The Act only applied to
      Christians. Thomas Greene was appointed Deputy Governor under Governor
      Stone. On 30 January 1649 Charles I was executed and in November of that
      year in Stone’s absence, Greene declared, on behalf of the Colony of
      Maryland, Charles II as the rightful King, much to the dismay of the new
      Puritan immigrants and many of the other Protestant settlers. Governor
      Stone retracted the proclamation. In July of 1650 Governor Stone visited
      Providence, made it a county called Ann Arundel and appointed Edward Lloyd
      its commander.
      <br />
      <br />Parliament appointed commissioners, Robert Dennis, Richard Bennett,
      Edward Curtis, Thomas Stagg and William Claiborne in December 1651 and
      sent them with 700 veteran soldiers from the Commonwealth Army to “Reduce
      all the plantations within the Chesapeake Bay to their due obedience to
      the Parliament of the Commonwealth of England.” The Commissioners went to
      Virginia first, received the submission of the colony, and arrived in
      Maryland in March 1652. The Parliament that appointed the Commissioners
      was dissolved by Cromwell in December of 1653, causing the authority of
      the Commissioners to come into question, at least in the mind of Governor
      Stone. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Governor Stone proclaimed
      Cromwell Lord Protector of England and the colony of Maryland in May when
      the Parliamentarian Commissioners were in Virginia, as a means of usurping
      their power. Governor Stone was reprimanded by the Commissioners and
      resigned, agreeing to submit to their will. He was initially removed from
      office, but by June was returned to the position of Governor with a
      governing council appointed by the Commissioners.
      <br />
      <br />On 5 July 1652, Commissioner Richard Bennett, along with Edward
      Lloyd, Captain William Fuller, Thomas Marsh and Leonard Strong signed the
      first Peace Treaty with the Susquehannocks. Jafer Peter from the Swedish
      Colony witnessed the proceedings. Having achieved peace with the
      Susquehannocks, Captain Fuller, a veteran of the New Model Army at the
      Battle of Dunbar, was ordered to conduct an expedition against the
      Nanticokes and Wicomicoes of the Eastern Shore but the expedition was
      abandoned due to both the lateness of the season and the unwillingness of
      the settlers at Providence to contribute men to the expedition.
      <br />
      <br />On orders from Lord Baltimore, Stone repudiated his submission to
      the Commonwealth Commissioners on 4 July1654 and accused the Puritans in
      the colony of rebellion against Lord Baltimore, the rightful proprietor of
      the colony. He retracted his statement on 22 July. A council consisting of
      Captain William Fuller, Richard Preston, William Durand, Edward Lloyd,
      Captain John Smith, Leonard Strong, John Lawson, John Hatch, Richard Wells
      and Richard Ewen was chosen to rule the colony. An assembly was called in
      October of 1654 and the Act of Toleration was revoked and the practice of
      Catholicism outlawed. The Loyalty Oath to Lord Baltimore, a requirement
      for landowners since the establishment of the Colony of Maryland, was
      revoked as well.
      <br />
      <br />In January 1655, the ship <i>Golden Fortune</i> arrived from England
      with William Eltonhead carrying a message to Captain Stone that
      <i>
        “The Lord Baltimore kept his patent and that his Highness, The Lord
        Protector, had neither taken the Lord Baltimore’s patent from him, nor
        his land.”
      </i>
      Lord Baltimore also accused Stone of
      <i>
        “Resigning up his government unto the hands of the Lord Protector and
        Commonwealth of England without striking one stroke.”
      </i>
      Stone assumed the role of Governor, issued commissions and began to
      organize the militia of St. Mary’s City, with a force of approximately 130
      men. As Governor, Stone announced that all land owners would be required
      to take an oath of fealty to Lord Baltimore within 3 months. Edward Lloyd
      and 77 settlers in Providence and Richard Preston along with 60 settlers
      in Patuxent sent a petition to Commissioners Bennett and Claiborne asking
      for relief from Stone’s requirement. Bennett and Claiborne urged them to
      stay loyal to the Commonwealth and resist taking the oath. Operating under
      orders from Governor Stone, John Hammond and a force of 20 men was sent to
      secure arms, ammunition and the colony records in Patuxent.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “Captain Stone gave several commissions to the papists and other
      despicable and bloody fellows, to muster and raise men in arms to be ready
      upon all occasions, giving out that he would go to Patuxent, and seize the
      records of the province at the place where they were appointed to be kept
      by an Act of the Assembly, and to apprehend Mr. Richard Preston also, at
      whose house they were; which shortly was effected by virtue of a warrant
      in Captain Stone’s name, without proclaiming, or shewing and power by
      which he acted such high robbers, But in threatening speeches declared,
      that they would have the government; and for the terror of others, would
      hang some of the commissioners of the Commonwealth of England, under His
      Highness, the Lord Protector, namely Captain William Fuller, Mr. Richard
      Preston and Mr. William Durand.”
    </blockquote>
    <h6>Leonard Strong</h6>
    <p>
      Governor Stone set out to attack Providence on the 20 March 1655. Part of
      his force marched up the bay and part went by sea. He was met enroute by a
      delegation of six men vicinity Herring Bay who delivered a proposal
      written by William Durant that asked that they be allowed to
      <i>“Enjoy the Liberty of English Subjects,”</i> be permitted to leave if
      they desired, and, if not,
      <i>
        “We are resolved to commit ourselves into the hands of God, and rather
        die like men that live like slaves.”
      </i>
      Stone took the six men captive and three escaped back to Providence and
      then continued north to Providence.
      <br />
      <br />Luke Barber, a former surgeon in the New Model Army accompanied
      Stone and went ahead to make a proclamation there, the content of which is
      unknown. He did not return to Stone.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “In the end of this declaration the governor did protest, as in the
      presence of Almighty God, that he came not in a hostile way to do them any
      hurt, but sought by all means possible, to reclaim them by faire meanes;
      and to my knowledge at the sending out of parties, as occasion served, he
      gave strict command, that if they met any Ann Arundel men, they should not
      fire the first gun, not upon paine of death plunder any. These were his
      actings to my knowledge upon the march.”
    </blockquote>

      Stone arrived at the outer harbor of Providence on the evening of 24 March
      with 11 or 12 vessels. With the appearance of Stone’s boats, Fuller
      convinced Roger Heamans, Captain of the
      <i>Golden Lyon</i>, to assist him.
      <br />
      <br />Heamans hailed the oncoming vessels to no avail and fired one of his
      guns. Once fired upon, Stone’s boats entered the mouth of Spa Creek and
      landed on Horn Point. Heamans fired on Stone’s men one more time. That
      evening a small ship under the command of Captain Cutt stood watch on the
      mouth of Spa Creek to prevent North’s men from attempting anything against
      the <i>Golden Lyon</i>. By the morning of the 25th, Fuller had sailed
      north out of Providence and down what is now known as College Creek,
      disembarked, and led his men the six miles to Horn Point.
      <br />
      <br />Fuller gave his men orders not to fire first. Fullers Company formed
      up within sight of Stones overnight encampment with Commonwealth flag
      unfurled which Fuller had taken from the <i>Golden Lyon</i>. One of
      Stone’s sentries fired a warning shot, then Stone’s men fired five or six
      guns, killing Fuller’s standard bearer. Fuller’s men shouted “In the name
      of God, fall on,’ and Stones men replied with “Hey for St Mary’s.” After
      the first volley some of Stone’s men took cover behind a fallen tree and
      continued to fire as the rest of Stone’s men fell back. Within 30 minutes
      Stone’s Company had been routed and threw down their arms in surrender.
      Stone’s Company was captured and had lost upwards of 40 men killed. Fuller
      had two killed and two that later died of wounds.

      This was the only battle of the Great Civil War fought in North America.
      Following the battle, ten of the leaders of the Proprietary army were
      condemned to death, with four executed and the rest released at the
      request of the inhabitants of Providence. The property of those who had
      opposed Captain Fuller were plundered and all were subject to fines.

      “They tried all your councilors by a council of war, and sentence was
      passed upon my husband to be shot to death, but was after saved by the
      enemy’s own soldiers, and so the rest of the councilors were saved by the
      petitions of the women, with some other friends they found there.”

      On November of 1657, Lord Baltimore reached an agreement with Bennett and
      Claiborne and resumed proprietorship. Religious toleration was restored
      and the events surrounding the Battle of the Severn were forgiven.
