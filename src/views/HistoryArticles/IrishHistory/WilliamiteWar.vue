      <h4>The Boyne Water</h4>
      <br />July the first, of a morning clear, one thousand six hundred and
      ninety, <br />King William did his men prepare—of thousands he had thirty-
      <br />To fight King James and all his foes, encamped near the Boyne Water;
      <br />He little feared, though two to one, their multitude to scatter.
      <br />
      <br />King William called his officers, saying: "Gentlemen, mind your
      station, <br />And let your valour here be shown before this Irish nation;
      <br />My brazen walls let no man break, and your subtle foes you’ll
      scatter, <br />Be sure you show them good English play as you go over the
      water."
      <br />
      <br />Both foot and horse they marched on, intending them to batter,
      <br />But the brave Duke Schomberg he was shot as he crossed over the
      water. <br />When that King William did observe the brave Duke Schomberg
      falling, <br />He reined his horse with a heavy heart, on the
      Enniskillenes calling:
      <br />
      <br />"What will you do for me, brave boys—see yonder men retreating?
      <br />Our enemies encouraged are, and English drums are beating." <br />He
      says, "My boys feel no dismay at the losing of one commander, <br />For
      God shall be our King this day, and I'll be general under."
      <br />
      <br />Within four yards of our fore-front, before a shot was fired,
      <br />A sudden snuff they got that day, which little they desired;
      <br />For horse and man fell to the ground, and some hung on their saddle:
      <br />Others turned up their forked ends, which we call coup de ladle.
      <br />
      <br />Prince Eugene's regiment was the next, on our right hand advanced
      <br />Into a field of standing wheat, where Irish horses pranced;
      <br />But the brandy ran so in their heads, their senses all did scatter,
      <br />They little thought to leave their bones that day at the Boyne
      Water.
      <br />
      <br />Both men and horse lay on the ground, and many there lay bleeding,
      <br />I saw no sickles there that day—but, sure, there was sharp shearing.
      <br />Now, praise God, all true Protestants, and heaven's and earth's
      Creator, <br />For the deliverance he sent our enemies to scatter.
      <br />The Church's foes will pine away, like churlish-hearted Nabal,
      <br />For our deliverer came this day like the great Zorobabal.
      <br />
      <br />So praise God, all true Protestants, and I will say no further,
      <br />But had the Papists gained that day, there would have been open
      murder. <br />Although King James and many more were ne'er that way
      inclined, <br />It was not in their power to stop what the rabble they
      designed.

      <h4>Lillibulero</h4>

      <br />Ho! brother Teague, dost hear the decree? <br />Lillibulero bullen a
      la, (repeated after each line) <br />Dat we shall have a new deputy?
      <br />Lillibulero bullen a la.
      <br />
      <br />Refrain: <br />Lero, lero, lillibulero, <br />lillibulero, bullen a
      la <br />Lero, lero, lillibulero, <br />lillibulero, bullen a la.
      <br />
      <br />Ho! by my soul, it is de Talbot, <br />And he will cut all de
      English throat.
      <br />
      <br />Though, by my soul, de English do praat, <br />De law's on dare
      side, and Creish knows what.
      <br />
      <br />But if dispence do come from de Pope, <br />We'll hang Magna Charta
      and dem in a rope.
      <br />
      <br />And de good Talbot is made a Lord, <br />And with brave lads is
      coming abroad.
      <br />
      <br />Who all in France have taken a sware, <br />Dat dey will have no
      Protestant heir.
      <br />
      <br />Ara! but why does he stay behind? <br />Ho' by my soul, 'tis a
      Protestant wind!
      <br />
      <br />But see, de Tyrconnel is now come ashore, <br />And we shall have
      commissions galore.
      <br />
      <br />And he dat will not go to mass <br />Shall be turn out, and look
      like an ass.
      <br />
      <br />But now de hereticks all go down, <br />By Creish and St. Patrick,
      de nation's our own.
      <br />
      <br />Dare was an old prophecy found in a bog, <br />" Ireland shall be
      ruled by an ass and a dog".
      <br />
      <br />And now dis prophecy is come to pass, <br />For Talbot's de dog, and
      James is de ass.
