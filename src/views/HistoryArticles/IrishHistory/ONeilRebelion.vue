    <h2>O'Neil’s Rebellion The Nine Years' War 1593-1603</h2>
    <p>
      Up until 1594 Hugh O'Neill, "The O'Neill", or, Earl of Tyrone, as he was
      known to the English, was pledged to the support of Elizabeth I Queen of
      England. The degree to which he took that commitment seriously can be
      measured by the fact that he took to the field with his brother in law,
      the English Marshall Bagnel, against Hugh Maguire, who was in rebellion
      against the English. This joint force defeated Maguire in 1593 at the
      battle known as "The Passage of the Erne at Belleek". After this
      engagement, O'Neill withdrew his support for the English, expressing
      several grievances to commissioners sent by Elizabeth I. One of his
      complaints was the absence of proper recognition for his support for the
      English Crown. The replacement of the Viceroy and a limit upon actions
      that could be taken against him, by his estranged English brother in law
      Bagenal among others, indicate that Elizabeth had considered his
      grievances favorably. The English were left with the impression that
      O'Neill was still loyal to the English Crown.
      <br>
      <br>In June of 1594, a soon to be ally of O'Neill, Hugh O'Donnell,
      ambushed and defeated an English relief column on the road to Ennniskillen
      at in a battle known as 'The Ford of the Biscuits". O'Neill was not
      present, but his brother Cormac was, along with 300 musketeers and 100
      horse. In February of 1595 his other brother, Art MacBaron, participated
      in the successful attack on an English fort at the ford of the Black
      River. It remains to be determined if O'Neill was supporting his brothers,
      as he remained aloof from the actions taken against the English.
      <br>
      <br>With the introduction of a new Viceroy, the English stepped up their
      efforts to end the on again off again resistance they were experience in
      their efforts to establish and supply English outposts on the edge of the
      Pale. The English increased the number of forces in Ireland. True to form,
      each of the three separate English armies were commanded by independent
      commanders unable or unwilling to support each other.
      <br>
      <br>O'Neill allied himself with Hugh O'Donnell, whose power base lay in
      Connaught and who was already out in rebellion. Tyrone's active role
      started with the investment of Monaghan Castle. O'Neill's brother in law,
      Bagenal, was able to supply the garrison of the castle, but was forced to
      contend with ambushes along his route of march. As Bagenal was leaving, en
      route to Newry, he was met by O'Neill at Clontibret who fought the column
      to a standstill with ambushes and harassing fire until sunset. The Irish
      demonstrated no attachment to castle or town and were perfectly willing to
      raze either in order to retain operational mobility and not tie down
      forces to defend them from the English. An English raid that destroyed
      Dungannon in August 1595, O'Neill's own castle had no effect on the Irish.
      <br>
      <br>In September of 1595 O'Neill sued for peace and pardon. The English
      at the time were at their most vulnerable but O'Neill may have had some
      appreciation for the inability of the Irish to defeat the English
      militarily and the fragile nature of his alliance. He used 1596 and 1597
      to stall the English, increase his efforts to get Spanish military support
      and to convince Irish leaders to join him or replace those who would not.
      <br>
      <br>O'Neill was executing a foreign policy of sorts in that he was
      appealing to Catholic Spain for aid against the Protestant English, using
      the restoration of the Catholic Church in Ireland as a basis for the
      request for troops and equipment. Despite his best efforts, Scots
      mercenaries were not forthcoming, but weapons were, purchased in England
      and Scotland.
      <br>
      <br>O'Neill had also begun a considerable modernization effort that
      continued throughout his rebellion, converting Kern to musket and caliver
      formations and converting some Gallowglas to pike formations as well as
      providing the requisite training and fielding the equipment necessary for
      the transition. Throughout this modernization initiative, O'Neill retained
      the flexibility to fight his army in the more traditional manner of
      fighting the English in Ireland, using hit and run tactics and ambushes
      against English formations moving across the Irish countryside. His
      modernization effort made it possible for him to at least retain the
      option of meeting the English on the field as equals, given enough time
      and training.
      <br>
      <br>The interlude of peace ended in July 1597. The new Viceroy, one Lord
      Brough, was on the offensive again and was met by O'Neill at the ford over
      the Blackwater River. He overcame the 40 Irish defenders in a small
      sconce, or fort, there with 1,000 men and proceeded to occupy the fort to
      cover the approaches to the ford. Brough lacked the forces or the will to
      carry the fight into Ulster and so remained in place. Bagenal conducted a
      raid into Ulster burning Dungannon but accomplishing little else.
      <br>
      <br>At Christmas of 1597 O'Neill met with Elizabeth's commissioners and
      in return for peace demanded a pardon, return of property of for his
      followers Liberty of Conscience, withdrawal of all English garrisons and
      Palatinate status for his holdings. Had the English agreed to that, it
      would have established a separate and independent Irish Kingdom with
      O'Neill as its ruler. The English did not agree to his terms and so both
      sides waited for summer to renew hostilities.
      <br>
      <br>By the summer of 1598, O'Neill was prepared to move again, invested
      the Blackwater Fort and waited for the English to come to the garrison's
      rescue. O'Neill met his former brother in law and old nemesis at the
      Yellow Ford. Bagenal's route of march went from Armagh on a narrow road
      through the Yellow Ford and from there to the fort on the Blackwater
      River. The engagement began when Bagenal's lead element reached a trench
      dug by the Irish across his route of march. Simultaneous attacks occurred
      on the lead element and trail elements with the center element raked by
      fire along its flanks. The English army disintegrated and fled the field
      after approximately an hour and a half with ¾ of the army dead or missing
      and Bagenal dead. The town of Parma was returned to O'Neill and the
      English abandoned the fort at Black Water.
      <br>
      <br>O'Neill's victory caused the Irish in all four provinces to rise up
      against the English. Even Munster, which had been put to fire and sword
      after the earlier Desmond uprising, was no longer safe for Englishmen.
      English refugees began gathering in walled cities and fleeing Ireland for
      England. Congratulations, as well as the possibility of support, came from
      Spain and the Pope in Rome. O'Neill began a "scorched earth" effort in
      preparation for an English attempt to retake previously held areas of
      Ireland.
      <br>
      <br>Elizabeth I accurately assessed the challenge England was facing and
      sent the largest force to date under the command of the Earl of Essex to
      put down O'Neill's uprising and to pacify Ireland. Essex moved south into
      Munster depleting his force by garrisoning towns along his route of march
      and failing to adequately feed his sick and starving army made up of
      inexperienced English conscripts. Essex did fight a brief engagement at
      the Pass of the Plumes in which he remained on the field of battle as the
      Irish fled and took Cahir Castle. Elizabeth grew impatient at the cost and
      lack of results of his campaign. When Essex finally turned north to fight
      O'Neill, he met him face to face, established a truce and departed for
      England never to return. O'Neill attempted to negotiate a peace from the
      truce asking England to recognize, in effect, a Catholic Kingdom of
      Ireland, with him as its ruler. Once again, the English refused to agree
      to such terms.
      <br>
      <br>In the spring of 1600 O'Neill faced Lord Montjoy who, by
      establishing a base of operations in the north west corner of Ireland
      under the control of Sir Henry Dowcra as well as sending Lord Carew south
      into Munster, began to threaten the alliance upon which the rebellion was
      based. Some of O'Neills more faint of heart followers began defecting to
      the English which led to an encirclement and an ever shrinking perimeter
      of land and towns he controlled in Tyrone. Montjoy, unlike his
      predecessors kept his forces in the field year round putting O'Neill under
      considerably more pressure than he was accustomed to. He also insured the
      harvest of 1600 did not take place, nor the planting of 1601.
      <br>
      <br>In the summer of 1600 a Spanish force landed on the southwest corner
      of Ireland at Kinsale. It is only possible to speculate as to why they
      landed so far away from Tyrone. Among the possible reasons were efforts by
      rebel leaders in Munster to have their position bolstered by the Spanish
      presence or that Kinsale was seen as a staging area for an invasion of
      England. In either case, O'Neill had to choose whether or when to leave
      his base of operations in Tyrone to move south to support the Spanish
      force. This was a difficult decision due to the fragile nature of his
      alliance making it likely that he might lose Tyrone upon his departure.
      <br>
      <br>Montjoy moved on Kinsale and invested it with little difficulty due
      to the Spanish failure to move out of Kinsale into the surrounding
      countryside. As Montjoy was surrounding Kinsale, O'Neill conducted several
      raids into the Pale probably in an effort to force Montjoy or Carew to
      focus on him and lift the siege of Kinsale. Montjoy refused to be
      distracted and let the Pale burn. By November, O'Neill and his long term
      ally O'Donnell, began to move south in two columns to relieve the Spanish.
      Both columns managed to outmaneuver an effort by Carew to impede their
      progress south.
      <br>
      <br>On Christmas Eve, 1601, after consolidating all his forces in front
      of Kinsale, O'Neill marched his forces onto the field in a three tercio
      formation of musket and pike. The English, under leaders far more
      experienced and soldiers more trained at this mode of traditional European
      warfare were able to outmaneuver the Irish formations and routed them from
      the field. The Spanish did not support the Irish with any attempt to
      breakout of Kinsale permitting the English to bring the majority of their
      forces to bear on O'Neill's forces in the battle and the follow on pursuit
      of the broken Irish formations. O'Neill fled and made his way north back
      to Tyrone.
      <br>
      <br>The battle of Kinsale in effect ended the rebellion even though
      O'Neill spent a year in hiding before making his submission to the
      English. During that year the English had taken control of all of Ireland.
      O'Neill's submission was accepted on the 24th of March, 1603 the day after
      Elizabeth I died. He remained in Ireland, stripped of his earldom and the
      title of "The O'Neill" until 17 September, 1607 when he fled Ireland with
      his fellow former Irish leaders, in an event called the "Flight of the
      Earls." Those not of noble blood stayed behind to feel the full wrath of
      the English, not to rise up again until 1636.
      <br>
      <br>Throughout the rebellion, the English were limited by terrain to
      only three avenues of approach out of the Pale to invade Ulster and
      Connaught. Initially the English sought to control the terrain by
      establishing a series of outposts along these routes. All but one of the
      major battles fought during the rebellion were fought on these routes. At
      Clonbriet, Blackwater Ford and Yellow Ford the Irish forces positioned
      themselves between an English garrison and a relieving or resupplying
      force. This gave the Irish the ability to chose the terrain upon which
      battles would take place, taking maximum advantage of their knowledge of
      the countryside. These battles can be described best as "running battles",
      with the Irish engaging English columns from the flanks and from prepared
      positions to the column's front. As the English would respond, the Irish
      would, if necessary to preserve combat power, withdraw in an orderly
      fashion to another position. In this manner the English seeking to
      resupply garrisons were forced to pay a high cost in manpower, lead and
      powder, all of which were is short supply and only replaceable across long
      supply lines reaching back to England. It was not until Montjoy bypassed
      these routes into Ulster and Connaught by landing on the northwest coast,
      sending Carew into Munster and keeping forces in the Pale that the English
      were able to break the stalemate the Irish were able to use to their
      advantage so successfully. Kinsale, the last battle of the uprising, found
      O'Neill attempting to meet the English on an open field. It is very likely
      that the battle was lost as a result of this first and only attempt to
      meet the English forces on an open field on English terms.

    <h3>A Brief Summary of Irish Military Organization in the 16th century</h3>
    <p>
      The highest office held by an Irishman outside those parts of Ireland
      occupied by the English in the 16th century was the usually hereditary
      Ceannfine or Chief of a Tuath (a tribal area occupying as much as 400
      square miles). Below him was his Tanist or the heir to the Ceannfine. Next
      in the hierarchy came the Urraigha, or sub-chiefs.
      <br>
      <br>The Urraigha were responsible for supporting the Ceannfine if called
      upon, in a Gairmsluaigh ("calling out") with all free men who were not
      Clergy, poets, harpers, physicians, scholars or lawyers. These were
      Cernagh, a term anglicized to Kern. They were expected to report with all
      weapons and three days worth of victuals. By mid 16th century those who
      were not free were also pressed into service. These were part time
      soldiers who augmented full time professional military men.
      <br>
      <br>The full time military in 16th century Ireland were called
      Buannadha, a term Anglicized to Buannacht or billeted men. They were paid
      "coyne and livery" which were their wages, or "coyne" and care for their
      horses if they owned any, or "livery."
      <br>
      <br>In a Ceannfine or Urraigh household it was possible to find both
      Cernagh and Galloglaich, a term anglicized to gallowglas, which means
      foreign warrior. The Galloglaich were mercenaries from families originally
      from the Western Isles and the western coast of Scotland that had been a
      military presence in Ireland since the 12th century.
      <br>
      <br>The Cernagh were typically armed with knife, sword, bow or darts
      transitioning over time to musket and caliver. They served as scouts and
      skirmishers. The Cernagh also served as cavalry, riding stirrup-less
      saddles and using lances in an overhand manner making them well suited for
      reconnaissance but unable to meet English cavalry in a stand up fight. The
      Galloglaich were typically armed with two-handed swords and or lochaber or
      sparth axes with some serving in pike formations as the 16th century
      progressed. There can be little doubt that there were no hard and fast
      rules concerning armament of these two groups. Each pair of Cernagh were
      entitled to a servant to help carry equipment. Each Galloglaich or mounted
      Cernagh was entitled to a pair of servants or "horse boys" to help carry
      equipment. The servants were armed with javelins or bows and expected to
      join their masters in battle.
      <br>
      <br>As the 16th century progressed, there were numerous Cernagh who
      became musketeers and calivermen while some of the Galloglaich migrated to
      the small number of pike used by the Irish. Firearms were of more value
      than pike in the hit and run tactics favored by the Irish against the
      English. ONeill, during his rebellion against the English crown, fostered
      this process of modernization.
      <br>
      <br>Another group appeared in Ireland in the late 16th century. They
      were the "New Scots" who, unlike their predecessors chose not to settle,
      but served in Irish armies and returned to Scotland. They were employed as
      horse or foot.
      <br>
      <br>The buannadha were organized into corrughadh, called a company or
      battle by the English and commanded by a consapal or captain. This was
      further divided into spars in the case of the Galloglaich, which consisted
      of one Galloglaich and two servants. A Galloglaich Corrughadh would
      usually consist of 60 to 80 Galloglaich with the consapal permitted to
      draw pay for an even 100; the difference being called "dead pays" and the
      source of the consapal's pay. Pay for Galloglaich was set at one bullock
      per quarter as pay and two for sustenance. The Cernagh received one heifer
      per quarter and victuals.
      <br>
      <br>The importance of the cattle herd roaming Ireland called creaghts
      cannot be over emphasized, as they provided the requisite augmentation to
      the field rations of oatmeal and whiskey needed to keep the army combat
      ready. Irish formations on the move would coordinate in advance a link up
      with one of these creaghts and boil the meat in its own hide, saving the
      army the need to carry cook pots.
