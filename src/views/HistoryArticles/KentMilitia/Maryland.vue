    <h2>A Brief Military History of the Colony of Maryland 1634-1707</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Maryland required a military organization from its inception in order to
      meet potential threats both external from Native Americans, France, Spain
      and fellow colonists from Virginia and internal threats to public order.
      The militia served as part time army as well as a police force. The
      militia was comprised of male “free men” between the ages of 16 and 60.
      Expeditions, or relatively small scale, short duration, offensive
      operations were drawn from militia, with the manpower requirements and, in
      some cases, the armaments, being met either voluntarily or involuntarily
      (“pressed”). Some of these expeditions drew from the militia of several
      counties and in the following list of units, I have indicated that when
      the available records have indicated that had occurred. Ranger
      organizations, of anywhere from three to as many as thirty men, were
      raised and funded on an annual basis, depending on the perceived threat.
      They were a mounted reconnaissance asset for the colony, garrisoning forts
      and or patrolling the western borders of the colony to provide early
      warning of Native American attack. The assumption seems to have been that
      sufficient early warning would be provided by the rangers to allow the
      militia to muster and respond to the threat. Maryland unlike Virginia and
      New York, never had “regular” units present in the colony. The definition
      of Regular Regiments and the Regular Independent Companies of the time was
      to have been authorized by the Crown, funded by Parliament and on the
      Official Army List. There is one unique company raised by CPT Gabriel
      Towson in Maryland and sent to Albany, NY to reinforce the city in King
      William’s War from 1690 to 1697. This unit perhaps comes the closest to
      meeting the definition of what would later in the 18th century be called a
      “provincial” unit, but still does not meet the definition of a “regular”
      unit.
      <br>
      <br>The following chronology is an effort to gather in one place all
      that remains of a fragmentary record of military actions in Maryland from
      the establishment of the colony to the Union of the Crowns.
    </p>
    <h3>Chronology</h3>
    <p>
      The Charter for the Colony of Maryland was granted in 1631 to Sir George
      Calvert, Lord Baltimore of Longford County, in the Irish Peerage. He died
      in 1632 and his son Cecil, rose to the Title and sent his two younger
      brothers, Leonard and George, along with 200 gentlemen adventurers and
      their families to settle a colony envisioned to be a place of refuge for
      Catholics. The colony was established on 3 March 1634. The colony was
      established as a “palatine,” giving the Proprietor a considerable amount
      of control over the colony and those in it including, an oath of loyalty,
      dispensing justice and land. Prior to the arrival of the Calverts and
      their colonists, Virginians under William Claiborne had established a
      trading post on Kent Island in 1631, not far from where Calvert had
      established his settlement. Claiborne was actively involved in the fur
      trade with the Susquehannock tribe and refused to recognize Calvert’s
      claim to the land where he had established his settlement. Claiborne had
      received permission to trade with the Dutch to the north as well as native
      Americans from the Governor of Virginia but not to establish any
      settlements and in 1633 Claiborne’s settlement was judged to be in the
      jurisdiction of Calvert’s colony by the King’s Star Chamber, the highest
      court of the time in England. The colony of Virginia objected and
      Claiborne was assured of his right to remain at Kent Island by the Crown.
      <br>
      <br>The colony of Maryland was established on 3 March 1634 on land
      previously occupied by the Piscataway tribe, who did not have friendly
      relations with the Susquehannocks. Initially relations with local tribes
      had been friendly but by July the demeanor of the Native Americans had
      changed and this was attributed to Claiborne’s influence. The settlers at
      St Mary’s built a fort in preparation for an attack that never
      materialized. By September Lord Baltimore directed his brother to arrest
      Claiborne and occupy his property on Kent Island. Calvert’s men seized one
      of Claiborne’s vessels and two armed ships were sent to Kent Island to
      attack Claiborne’s settlement. Claiborne attacked the two vessels on 23
      April 1635, the first known sea battle on the Chesapeake. With Claiborne
      absent and their ships destroyed in the sea action, the settlement on Kent
      Island surrendered to Calvert’s authority and Claiborne began his long
      legal battle to regain his land and control of the settlement on Kent
      Island.
      <br>
      <br>Lord Baltimore’s plan for land distribution in the colony was that
      manors would be established with tenants farming the land. The amount of
      land granted for manors was based on the number of tenants brought to
      Maryland. This was an essentially a medieval English land distribution
      plan and failed to consider new ideas about land ownership evolving in
      Britain. The settlement of St Mary’s became a county by 1637. That same
      year, Lord Baltimore reorganized the colony’s government, with Governor
      Calvert supported by three councilors and a single legislative body. Kent
      Island was ‘commanded” by Captain Robert Evelyn beginning in December 1637
      and, by 1638, was called “Kent Hundred” in the County of St Mary’s.
      <br>
      <br>On 25 January 1638, the first colonial assembly met at St Mary’s
      City comprised of “freemen” or those males between the ages of 16 and 60
      who were not indentured servants. The first assembly was small enough to
      be conducted as a plebiscite but all others would be representative
      assemblies. The assembly agreed to the construction of Fort Inigoe across
      the river from St Mary’s City. Apparently unrest on Kent Island, allegedly
      involving the freeing of detained prisoners and conspiring with
      Susquehannocks, required a resolution at this first assembly that called
      for the imposition of martial law and sending an armed expedition under
      the command of Governor Calvert and Captain Cornwallis to subdue the
      island. There is no record of the outcome of this expedition. William
      Brainthwayte replaced Evelyn in late 1638 as Captain and commander of Kent
      Island only to be replaced by Giles Brent in February of 1639.
      <br>
      <br>In May of 1639 Giles Brent was appointed “Captain of the Military
      Band” of the colony and was instructed to train all the colonists able to
      bear arms, council excluded, in “the art and discipline of war on holy
      days and any other time there should be need.” He or one of his
      subordinates was also required to insure each home had the required arms
      and ammunition, one serviceable gun, a shot bag, one pound of powder, four
      pounds of shot, a sword and a belt per man, with a fine of 30 pounds of
      tobacco to be exacted as punishment for noncompliance. The militia would
      consist of the free men of the colony and were organized into military
      units based on the “hundred”, a subset of a county, in which the men
      resided. Sergeants were compensated for instructing the men in military
      drill. In the same month of May an expedition of 30 men with “necessary
      officers” and supplies were to be pressed (or forced into military
      service) and sent to Kent Island to conduct operations against the
      Susquehannocks. There is no record of actions by this expedition. William
      Brianthwayte replaced Giles Brent as Captain and commander of Kent Island
      in August of 1639.
      <br>
      <br>In July of 1641 the Governor instructed the residents of Kent Island
      to shoot on sight any Native Americans. It was believed that the natives
      threatening Kent Island were a group located vicinity Chestertown and had
      upwards of sixty fighting men armed with muskets while Kent Island could
      muster no more than perhaps twenty five men. In March of 1642 Governor
      Calvert summoned an assembly to discuss the hostility of Native Americans
      and how to respond. Of the 78 free men of the colony 30 were represented
      by six proxy holders. All the inhabitants of Kent Island were represented
      by two men who held all their proxies. In June of 1642, the Governor
      ordered that Native Americans could not be sold guns or ammunition, and
      that arms be provided for all “able to bear arms.” All available men were
      directed to be armed when away from home and that firing a weapon was to
      be an alarm. In the same month, orders were sent to Captain Robert Evelyn
      to levy, train and muster the settlers near Piscataway. A fort near the
      Patuxent was put under the command of Henry Bishop in August and orders
      were given that the alarm signal was to be three sequential discharges
      from a firearm that when heard was to be followed by the evacuation of
      women and children to local forts and strong houses. Once the evacuation
      had occurred, the militia were to “keep guard.” The forts were St Inigoes
      Fort, Thomas Sterman’s House in St Michael’s Hundred, Thomas Weston’s
      House in St George’s Hundred and Patuxent Fort.
      <br>
      <br>In September the Susquehannock, Wicomico and Nanticoke tribes were
      declared “enemies to the province.” The colonial assembly raised an
      expedition to attack the Susquehannock by enlisting every third man out of
      each hundred armed, provisioned for two months and transported by their
      hundred with the cost divided between the residents of the hundred. Each
      member of the expedition was to be provided by the county, if he did not
      already have it, “one fixed gunne, 2 pounds of powder, 8 pounds pistol or
      bullet shot, 1 sword and 2 months provisions,” Uniquely, compensation for
      disability of those sent on the expedition was called for by the assembly.
      Captain Brainthwaite, the commander of the expedition, took sixteen men to
      Kent Island where Captain Brent refused to force men to serve on the
      expedition, thereby preventing the expedition to continue due to lack of
      manpower. On 16 December 1642 Giles Brent was commissioned by Governor
      Calvert to be “Commander of our Isle and County of Kent,” including three
      commissioners allowing for a separate county court. In January of 1643 a
      peace treaty was negotiated with the Nanticokes but a state of war
      continued to exist between Maryland and the Susquehannock and Wicomico.
      Governor Calvert left the colony in April of 1643 leaving Giles Brent as
      governor in his absence. Brent and Calvert both attempted to put together
      expeditions against their Native American enemies but were unable to
      convince the colony’s council or assembly to raise the necessary men and
      supplies. Virginia was unwilling to join with Maryland in joint
      expeditions as well. The best that could be achieved was a ten man
      expedition to garrison Palmers Island at the mouth of the Susquehanna
      River to observe the enemy. In the summer of 1643, Captain Cornwallis led
      an expedition up the Susquehanna River to a Susquehannock village but was
      driven off, failing to end the continual raids against the settlements of
      the colony.
      <br>
      <br>The Great Civil War that was already two years old in the British
      Isles reached Maryland in January of 1644. Captain Richard Ingle was no
      stranger to Maryland as he had been involved for several years in the
      annual tobacco fleet which brought good from England to Maryland and
      Virginia and took back the annual tobacco crop to England. His
      Parliamentarian sympathies were known as well. His remarks about King
      Charles resulted in his imprisonment and the seizure of his ship, the
      Reformation. Both were temporary and it seemed that economic necessity
      both the ship captains and the colonies overrode political loyalties, for
      the moment.
      <br>
      <br>Leonard Calvert returned to Maryland in September of 1644 and by the
      end of the month went to Virginia leaving William Brianthwaite to serve as
      deputy governor of the colony. By October William Ingle was on his way
      back to Maryland with a letter of marque allowing him to seize ‘enemy’
      ships from Parliament in hand. In December of 1644, William Claiborne made
      a failed attempt to raise the people of Kent Island. In January of 1645
      Ingle sailed into St Mary’s and found a Dutch vessel, The Looking Glass,
      conducting a brisk trade with the Marylanders. Ingle departed for Virginia
      to find additional men to attack Maryland. Returning in February, Ingle
      attacked the Looking Glass, causing her to lower her colors and surrender.
      Ingle then proceeded to hunt down the Catholic colonial leaders and to
      loot the homes of the wealthy. Protestant settlers either supported Ingle
      or remained neutral and the outnumbered Catholics supported Calvert and
      his government. Calvert and his men built and garrisoned St Thomas Fort
      and Ingles men built a fort around Calvert’s abandoned house. By April
      Ingle had departed St. Mary’s for England with The Looking Glass as his
      prize only to be disappointed by the refusal of the Parliamentarian
      Admiralty Courts to recognize the legitimacy of his actions in taking her.
      Those who stayed back in Maryland asserted their control of the colony,
      taking St Thomas Fort by late in the summer of 1645. Leonard Calvert was
      not taken but fled to Virginia. With no legal basis for its existence, the
      government Ingle left behind was unable to perform only the most
      rudimentary functions of government. Captain Edward Hill went to St Mary’s
      City in July of 1646 to retrieve men who had fled from Virginia and found
      himself governor of the colony until December of that year.
      <br>
      <br>Hill was operating under Leonard Calvert’s orders and found himself
      only able to control events in St Mary’s County, with Kent County refusing
      to recognize Hill’s or Calvert’s authority. By late December Calvert
      returned to Maryland with a company of men raised in Virginia comprised of
      Virginians, Maryland refugees and assumed control with little or no
      resistance.
      <br>
      <br>William Claiborne returned to Kent Island in December of 1646 and
      attempted unsuccessfully to convince the local populace to march on St.
      Mary’s City. Calvert and his men regained control of Kent County in April
      of 1647. Calvert died in June and was replaced by Thomas Greene in June of
      1647. In July of 1647 COL John Price was ordered to assemble a company of
      thirty to forty men and attack the Nanticoke and Wicomick villages. There
      is no record of the results of this expedition. Cecil Calvert, Lord
      Baltimore and Leonard’s brother replaced Thomas Green with William Stone,
      a Virginian and the first Protestant Governor of the colony in August
      1648. Recent events had shrunk the population of Maryland and Stone
      brought with him five hundred puritan settlers who had been made unwelcome
      in Virginia who established the settlement of Providence, in current Ann
      Arundel County.
      <br>
      <br>The first colonial assembly under Governor Stone was presented with
      an Act Concerning Religion which they modified and adopted as the law in
      Maryland. The Act called for religious toleration and forbade insulting
      language about religion, a first in British Law. The Act only applied to
      Christians. Thomas Greene was appointed Deputy Governor under Governor
      Stone.
      <br>
      <br>On 30 January 1649 Charles I was executed and in November of that
      year Greene declared, on behalf of the Colony of Maryland, Charles II as
      the rightful King, much to the dismay of the new Puritan immigrants and
      many of the other Protestant settlers. Governor Stone retracted the
      proclamation but Parliament in the face of opposition in Virginia as well
      as Maryland, sent two commissioners, Richard Bennett and William Claiborne
      from England to “reduce all the plantations within the Chesapeake Bay to
      their due obedience to the parliament of the commonwealth of England.” The
      Commissioners went to Virginia first to establish Parliamentary control
      first, and arrived in Maryland in March 1652. Governor Stone was initially
      displaced but by June was returned to the position of Governor with a
      council appointed by the Commissioners. In July the first Peace Treaty
      with the Susquehannocks was signed in November 1652. With the
      Susquehannocks pacified, CPT William Fuller’s was ordered to conduct an
      expedition against the Nanticokes and Wicomicoes of the Eastern Shore but
      the expedition was abandoned eastern shore in part due to both the
      lateness of the season and the unwillingness of the settlers at Providence
      to contribute men to the expedition.
      <br>
      <br>The Parliamentarian Commissioners, appointed by a Parliament
      dismissed by Cromwell in December 1653, were in Virginia when Governor
      Stone, in May, proclaimed Cromwell Lord Protector of England and the
      colony of Maryland. They returned to Maryland and replaced Governor Stone
      with a council to rule Maryland in July. In January 1655 after Lord
      Baltimore attacked him for surrendering to the Commissioners, Governor
      Stone began to organize an armed force in St Mary’s County of
      approximately 130 men. Operating under orders from Governor Stone, CPT
      Josias Fendall leading a force of 20 men was involved in a raid to secure
      arms, ammunition and the colony records in Patuxent.
      <br>
      <br>Governor Stone set out to reduce Providence in the 20 March 1655.
      Part of his force marched up the bay and part went by sea to the Severn
      River and arrived at the outer harbor of Providence by 24 March. Governor
      Stone landed his force, under fire from the ship Golden Lyon, and formed
      up his forces under the black and yellow colors of the Baltimore coat of
      arms. CPT Fuller with a force of approximately 170 men attempted to meet
      Stone’s force on the rear or flank. Hoping to resolve the situation with a
      parley, CPT Fuller ordered his men to not fire. Fuller raised the
      Commonwealth Colors and Stone’s men opened fire, killing one man. One
      volley and a follow on charge routed Stone’s army. The Proprietary force
      suffered seventeen men killed and thirty two wounded and CPT Fuller lost
      had three men killed and several wounded. This was the only battle of the
      Great Civil War fought in North America. Following the battle, ten of the
      leaders of the Proprietary army were condemned to death, with four
      executed and the rest released as a result of the request from the
      inhabitants of Providence. The property of those who had opposed CPT
      Fuller were plundered and all were subject to fines. The Puritans were in
      control of the colony until 10 July 1656 when Josias Fendall was made
      governor of Maryland by Lord Baltimore, who’s claim to the colony was in
      dispute in England. CPT Fuller and others arrested Fendall until he swore
      “not to disturb the present government,” until a final decision came from
      England. By September 1656, the English Protectorate Board of Trade
      decided entirely on Lord Baltimore’s behalf and Fendall was confirmed as
      Governor. On 7 November Lord Baltimore’s brother, Cecil was confirmed as
      secretary of the colony. In 1657 Josias Fendall left the colony for
      England leaving Luke Barber, the former physician of Cromwell as the
      acting governor in his absence. The colony remained divided with separate
      governments in Providence and St Mary’s until April 1658, when Lord
      Baltimore assumed control of the entire colony. In March 1660 Fendall led
      an abortive attempt to take control of the Colony which failed with the
      Restoration of Charles II on 29 May 1660. Lord Baltimore made Phillip
      Calvert the Governor of Maryland in June 1660. In 1661 a militia act was
      passed by the assembly that called for enlistment in the militia on an as
      needed basis only with those enlisted required to provide their own
      weapons and fines or imprisonment for failure to do so. In this same year
      Maryland assisted the Susquehannocks in their war with the Seneca by
      providing a company of 50 men to help defend their fort. In May 1661, CPT
      John Odber was instructed by the assembly to “choose some fit place either
      within or without the forte which you are to fortify for your own
      security,” as well as to “cause some spurs or flankers to be laid out for
      defense of the Indian fort, whom you are upon all occasions to assist
      against the assaults of their enemies.” Additionally, CPT Odber’s Company
      was to pay particular attention to Susquehannock interaction with the
      Dutch. His Company was raised by men levied or pressed with St Mary’s
      County providing 11, Calvert providing 15, Charles providing 7, Anne
      Arundel providing 11 and Kent providing 3. By November it became apparent
      that the Susquehannocks were unwilling to provide the agreed assistance to
      CPT Odber’s Company, that being provisions and assistance in constructing
      fortifications. The Company departed that same month. In 1662 Charles
      Calvert assumed the Governorship of Maryland
      <br>
      <br>By 1664 the assembly voted to tax inhabitants of the colony to allow
      for purchase of arms and ammunition for defense of the colony with those
      arms to be stored at county magazines. Charles Calvert the governor
      provided 250 muskets as well as swords and belts for the county arsenals
      that same year. Weapons could be pressed, or confiscated from owners, into
      county or colony service if required in an emergency. The system of the
      colony providing arms and ammunition to the colonial militia remained in
      place well into the 18th century. The Susquehannock war with the Seneca
      spilled over into Maryland with several colonists killed and war declared
      on the Seneca in June 1664. By 1674 Maryland’s position with respect to
      the Susquehannocks had changed and peace was made with the Seneca,
      recognizing their victory over the Susquehannock, causing a break down in
      relations with the Susquehannocks. In 1675 an expedition consisting of a
      regiment of horse, with five troops of fifty men each was raised to attack
      the Susquehannock Fort. The expedition was commanded by MAJ Thomas Truman.
      The expedition was conducted in coordination with a force from Virginia
      commanded by COL John Washington. Once at the fort on 26 Sep 1675, five
      Susquehannock leaders left the fort to meet with the Marylanders and
      Virginians. When a detachment of rangers under CPT John Allen arrived at
      the fort with the bodies of dead settlers, the Susquehannock leaders were
      executed. The Maryland and Virginia forces then besieged the fort of six
      weeks until the Susquehannock completely evacuated of the fort at night
      killing several sentries as they left. MAJ Truman was brought up on
      charges of murder but the lower house of the colonial assembly refused to
      permit his execution and after a brief time in jail he was released.
      Thomas Notley was made Governor in 1676.
      <br>
      <br>In Sept 1676 a rebellion occurred in Calvert County, with sixty men
      refusing orders to disarm and disband until confronted by MAJ Henry Jowles
      and a company of militia. The reason for the rebellion is unknown but can
      be suggested by ongoing complaints against the proprietary government
      about excessive taxation, advancement of Catholicism, Catholic favoritism,
      and a groundless accusation that Lord Baltimore was conspiring with French
      and Indians to kill Protestants. That same year, an expedition was raised
      to attack the Nanticokes in to be commanded by COL William Coleborne, but
      there is no record of the outcome of this expedition. Charles Calvert
      became governor in 1679.
      <br>
      <br>In 1681, the same concerns and groundless rumors that caused a
      revolt in 1676 with the added twist of an Irish army being invited to
      Maryland to wipe out the Protestants led to the arrest of two prominent
      member of the colony spreading the rumors, former Governor Josias Fendall
      and CPT John Coode. Their arrest did nothing to stop the rumors and CPT
      George Godfrey organized a militia company in Charles County to march to
      St Mary’s to free them. Gofrey’s attempt failed and he was charged with
      banishment. Fendall was banished as well and Coode was freed with a
      warning. In 1684 a council of deputy governors ruled Maryland on behalf of
      the minor child Benedict Calvert until 1689.
      <br>
      <br>In November of 1688 William of Orange landed in England beginning a
      period of revolution, instability, uncertainty and war in Britain and the
      colonies. The colonies were waiting for a decree from the new monarchs,
      William and Mary in the spring of 1689 and this decree was lost on its way
      to Maryland. By April 1689 an “Association in arms for the defense of the
      Protestant Religion and for asserting the rights of King William and Queen
      Mary to the province of Maryland “ was formed. In July a seven hundred man
      army under Captain John Coode, Colonel Henry Jowles and Major John
      Campbell claiming it was necessary to overthrow the proprietary government
      because “the Papists had invited the Northern Indians to come down and cut
      off the Protestants” in August, a complete fabrication. Colonel William
      Digges attempted to defend the State House at St Mary’s City with one
      hundred men and surrendered after a short fire fight. Colonel Henry Darnel
      and Major Nicholas Sewall tried to put together a relief force but were
      only able to assemble a force of about one hundred and fifty men and were
      unable to challenge Coode’s force. Darnell and Sewell withdrew to
      Mattapnay Sewall and surrendered on 1 August 1689. Coode and the
      “Associators” ruled Maryland until 1692.
      <br>
      <br>In 1690 a company under CPT Gabriel Towson led a company raised to
      strengthen Albany, NY during King William’s War from 1690 to 1697. In 1692
      Sir Lionel Copely arrived as the first Royal Governor of Maryland. His
      first assembly established the Church of England as the church of the
      colony. Copley died in 1692 and Sir Thomas Lawrence and Sir Edmund Andros
      briefly followed as Governors.
      <br>
      <br>In 1693 three forts were constructed to defend the western frontier
      of the colony from Native Americans, one in Charles County, one in Anne
      Arundel County and another near the falls of the Patapsco River. CPT John
      Addison and COL Nicholas Greenberry constructed the forts with pressed
      labor and each of the forts were garrisoned by nine militiamen and four
      Native Americans.
      <br>
      <br>In July 1694 Francis Nicholson became Governor of Maryland and moved
      the capital from St Mary’s City to Ann-Arundel Town, now Annapolis in
      1695. He was succeeded by Nathaniel Blackiston until 1704. John Seymour
      became Governor in 1704 until 1709. In 1705 Richard Clarke was accused of
      leading an attempted uprising of indentured servants, Indians and slaves
      which was put down with the ringleaders disappearing after seizing a ship.
