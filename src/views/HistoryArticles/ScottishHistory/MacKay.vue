    <h2>MacKay’s Regiment of Foote, (1626-1634)</h2>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      The Scottish mercenary had been a fixture in Europe since at least the 12
      century. Perhaps no other time was this Scottish presence more felt on the
      continent that in the early 17th century. Current estimates are that there
      were 38,550 soldiers raised over 27 levies from1624-42 authorized by
      Charles I and Privy Council of Scotland for service in Danish and Swedish
      armies. If all levies were met and the current estimate of the population
      of 850.000 of Scotland is accurate then it would have amounted to between
      4 and 5 per cent of the population and as much as one fourth of the adult
      male population. This is no small contribution and the Scots soldiers and
      their Scots officers were a major presence in the Danish and Swedish
      armies during the 30 Years War.
      <br />
      <br />Whether motivated by economic necessity, adventure or greed, these
      soldiers made a major difference wherever and whenever called into action.
      They served with honor and courage wherever they fought and for whomever
      they fought. They also brought home those skills and, in some cases,
      plundering ways, to Scotland and made their presence felt during the War
      of Three Kingdoms.

    <h3>Chronology of the Regiment</h3>
    <p>
      <b>1626</b> The Regiment raised by Sir Donald Mackay of Farr (First Lord
      Reay) under a military levy with a charter granted by Charles I, King of
      Britain. The regiment’s first levy was completed by years end in 1626 and
      shipped to Denmark for service under General Peter Ernst, the Graf von
      Mansfeld, a Catholic mercenary in Danish Service.

      is down on his luck can still get a dollar from MacKay) Scottish saying
