    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      As a result of wars, marriages and political maneuvering most of the
      region currently known as Belgium and The Netherlands were in the hands of
      the Dukes of Burgundy. Charles V the Holy Roman Emperor was the ruler of
      this region by 1515. By the mid 16th century the Hapsburg controlled
      Netherlands was comprised of 3 million people with 300 cities in 17
      provinces, the southern three Walloon speaking and the northern 14
      speaking Dutch. The representative assembly for the Netherlands was the
      States General (“Staten-Generaal”), first called into being by Philip the
      Good in 1464. Antwerp was one of the economic centers of Europe and the
      place from which the gold bullion coming from the New World was exchanged.
      The Hapsburg-Valois Wars with France ended in 1559 with the Treaty of
      Cateau-Cambrésis making the movement of people and ideas easier in Western
      Europe. One of the ides on the move was Calvinist Protestantism out of
      Geneva. It found particular support from the numerous lower class, lesser
      noble and townsfolk in the Netherlands.

    <h4>Reforms of Maurice of Nassau to the Staatse Leger</h4>
    <p>
      Beginning in 1589 Maurice of Nassau sough to reform the Army of the States
      General. This process began with the use of constant drilling of the
      soldiers in the handling of their individual weapons and in the movement
      of formations. The drill book The Exercise of Armes, drawn by De Geyn in
      1608, depicts graphically the individual musket and pike drill introduced
      by Maurice of Nassau. Soldiers were taught to count the different
      movements in unison in battle to aid in coordinated formation movement as
      well as, in the case of musketeers, to allow for effective volley firing.
      Infantry formations were 10 ranks in depth and each half regiment of would
      have 250 pike men flanked on either side by 80 musketeers. This formations
      would, in turn be flanked by cavalry ands supported by a second and third
      echelon in a checkerboard pattern. The words of command for the army,
      comprised of Dutch, German, French, Scottish, and English soldiers were
      shared by all soldiers regardless of nationality. Commands of preparation,
      in addition to commands of execution, were introduced as well. Soldiers
      were expected to dig their own defensive positions and local civilians
      were, for the first time, not forced or paid to dig for the army. Cavalry
      drills were not introduced but lancers were dispensed with and all cavalry
      were armed with carbine (harquebus) and or pistols.
      <br>
      <br>The willingness of the soldiers to accept the innovation of constant
      drill and to drill during the winter months, during which there had
      typically been no activity, was, in all probability, based on the
      knowledge that they would be paid on a regular basis. This made it
      possible for the soldiers to be worked harder and prevent them from being
      the burden on the population and danger to civilians that the irregularly
      paid Spanish, Italian, German and Southern Province soldiers fighting
      against the United Province were.

    <h4>
      A Description of the uniforms and equipment of the troops arriving in the
      Low Countries
    </h4>
    <i class="appendix">
      “There is a description of these soldiers, in Kervyn de Lettenhove’s Les
      Huguenots et les Geux, Tome III, PG 46. which states that the
      harquebusiers maintained the uniforms they had worn in England: blue
      cassocks with yellow and red facing, and red crosses. However wile some of
      these regular troops wore uniforms, most of the mercenary companies would
      not have adopted any particular colours. In general, equipment would have
      remained functional, with musketeers and harquebusiers clothed in fustian
      doublets, chain mail jackets, and sometimes corselets and steel helmets,
      carrying a sword and dagger. The pikemen might have been more heavily
      armed, wearing steel corselets and metal pouldrons, vambraces and tasses
      and most certainly a steel cap. However for the sake of mobility, this
      equipment was often limited to a breast and back plate, and in the low
      countries there were few pitched battles that warranted the use of heavy
      armor. Many of the mercenary companies were very poorly clad, and existed
      in extreme discomfort pending payment for their services; arms and
      equipment were often in short supply.”

    <h4>Origin of the term “beggars” (geuzen)</h4>
    <p>
      On the 5th of April 1566 Louis of Nassau and Count Brederode, both nobles
      sympathetic to the Protestants of the Netherlands, along with 400 of their
      fellow nobles presented the Compromise of Breda to Margaret of Parma, the
      illegitimate sister of King Phillip of Spain and his regent in the
      Netherlands. The Compromise was a request for an end to the work of the
      Inquisition and a removal of Spanish occupying forces for the Netherlands.
      The regent was at first alarmed at the appearance of so large a body, but
      one of her councilors, Berlaymont, was heard to exclaim, “What, madam, is
      your highness afraid of these beggars” (“ces gueux”)? At a meeting held by
      some 300 confederates at the Hotel Culemburg three days later, Brederode
      in a speech declared that if need be they were all ready to become beggars
      in their country’s cause. The French word for beggar is gueux which was
      rapidly transformed into geuzen and became the proud title of those who
      opposed Spanish rule in the Netherlands and “Vivent le geux” was heard on
      the streets of the Netherlands.

    <h4>Role and Rights of Women in 16th -17th century Holland</h4>
    <blockquote>“The man is head of the family, but the woman is the neck, that allows the head to move”</blockquote>
    <h6>an old Dutch Saying</h6>
    <p>Calvinist Doctrine expected obedience of the wife towards the husband and the daughter towards her father. Dutch women, however, had unique rights. The Dutch legal system in the 17th century allowed a woman to institute legal proceedings against somebody, even against her husband. If she was unmarried and had not reached the age of adulthood (25) she needed a guardian. An unmarried pregnant woman could persecute the alleged father in a paternity procedure. She could force him to marry her and if he was already married she could demand a dowry, payment of childbirth costs and an allowance for the child. Women were also able to own property.</p>
